# Bartleby

Bartleby is a LLM chatbot constructed using the HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta model. The project goal was to create a conversational writing assistant which can be interacted with naturally and conversationally to conveniently create documents in docx format. A 'universal' conversational interface was achieved using the Matrix protocol (i.e. the user can interact with the assistant via any matrix chat client application using any device: phone, laptop or tablet running: macOS, Windows, Linux, android IOS etc,). Documents are created and accessed via Google Drive using Google Cloud Platform APIs.

## Prerequisites

1. Access to a matrix server with the ability to create a room and user for the bot.
2. A google developer account with a service account that has edit access to a google drive folder.
3. A python 3+ install with Huggingface transformers and a NVIDIA GPU.
